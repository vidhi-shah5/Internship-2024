# Internship-2024

 Week 1:

Day 1: Basics of Penetration Testing Learned about the fundamentals of penetration testing: 
I started by understanding what penetration testing (pen testing) is, its objectives, and the different types of pen testing (black-box, white-box, and gray-box). I also learned about the phases of a pen test, including planning, reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and reporting. Understood the importance and role of penetration testing in cybersecurity: 
I explored how pen testing helps identify vulnerabilities in systems before malicious attackers can exploit them. This proactive approach is crucial for strengthening an organization’s security posture and ensuring compliance with various security standards and regulations. 
Day 2: OSCP Udemy Course Learned about active and passive reconnaissance: 
I delved into the techniques used to gather information about a target system. Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target (e.g., scanning ports), while passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without direct interaction (e.g., using public records or social media). Gained knowledge on various web attacks: 
I studied different types of web attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). I learned how these attacks work, their potential impact, and basic mitigation strategies. 
Day 3: Recon Labs on PenLabs Applied the learned concepts in practical scenarios:
 I put theoretical knowledge into practice by working on reconnaissance labs. This hands-on experience helped I understand how to gather information about a target system effectively. Gained hands-on experience in performing reconnaissance: 
I practiced using various tools and techniques to perform reconnaissance, such as network scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability assessment. This practical experience is essential for developing Ir skills as a penetration tester. 
Day 4: Brushing Up Linux Commands Reviewed and practiced various Linux commands: 
I revisited essential Linux commands that are frequently used in penetration testing, such as ls, cd, grep, awk, sed, netstat, and nmap. Understood their usage in different scenarios: 
I learned how to use these commands in various contexts, such as navigating the file system, searching for specific information, and managing network connections. Mastery of these commands is crucial for efficiently performing tasks during a pen test. 
Day 5: Learning New Tools for Reconnaissance Explored and understood the functionality of various reconnaissance tools: 
I discovered new tools that can aid in the reconnaissance phase of a pen test, such as Nmap, Wireshark, Maltego, and theHarvester. Learned how to effectively use these tools in penetration testing: 
I practiced using these tools to gather information about target systems, analyze network traffic, and map out the attack surface. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each tool helps I choose the right one for specific tasks.

Day 4: Active Directory - Part 1 Basics: Learned about Active Directory (AD) and its role in network resource management. Structure: Understood AD’s structure, including domains, trees, forests, and organizational units. Tasks: Started with basic AD tasks like creating users and groups, and assigning permissions. 
Day 5: Active Directory - Part 2 Advanced Tasks: Continued with advanced AD tasks, including managing Group Policy and administrative tasks. Vulnerabilities: Learned about common AD vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies. Practice: Practiced various AD tasks in a controlled environment.
